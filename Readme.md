# Using the Github API
Exercise to reproduce the basics of a Github user page using JSON data, jQuery, Underscore

- Awful styling a result of some experimenting
- Didn't get around to implementing Github's octicons
- Didn't get around to doing the date converstion
- Later revisiting of this homework was an attempt to refactor earlier code with Neat (which I learned is generally not a good idea to do after the layout has already been rendered fairly accurately in the first place)
